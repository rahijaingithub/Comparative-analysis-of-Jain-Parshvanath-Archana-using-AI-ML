## Background
In Digamber Jain tradition, God (*Bhagwan*) *archana* forms an important part of practicing the religion. However, many devotees, especially younger generation, may struggle to comprehend the meaning and importance of performing *archana*. Further, existence of different forms of *archana* like *Puja*, *Aarti* and *Chalisa* only adds to the complexity of comprehending the practice.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the new disruptive technologies which have gained the traction for their abilities to process literature and knowledge and provide valuable insights. Thus, it will be relevant to use the AI and ML techniques to understand the different *archanas* done in the Digamber Jain tradition.

This study compares the three different forms of  *archana* i.e., *Puja*, *Aarti* and *Chalisa* to better understand their thematic similarities and differences. A case study approach is used, thus *archana* literature of Parshvanath *Bhagwan* is used for this study.

## Methodology
The methodology for the study could be divided into five main steps namely, data collection, theme selection, prompt engineering and AI analysis, expert review and data analysis. The first step in the study is data collection. The relevant literature on Parshvanath *Bhagwan archana* is collected using purposive sampling approach. The next step is theme selection where the themes used for comparing the sample literature are selected using expert judgement. An expert devotee from the JSOT, Toronto temple was consulted and explained the purpose of this study. 

Prompt engineering was the next step which used zero-shot prompting combined with persona prompting (ZSP). The ZSP prompt approach was selected based on various preliminary trial performance of zero-shot prompting approach with and without persona prompting. The Retrieval Augumented Generation (RAG) integrated Large Language Model (LLM) was used as the AI model to analyse the sample literature based on prompts. Compared to standard LLM models which uses only its static trained data to provide response to a prompt, RAG based LLM architecture allows the LLM model to search and analyze the external data before providing response to the prompts. Thus, RAG based LLM can provide more accurate results. A free version of commercially available AI tool called ChatPDF was used for AI analysis.

Expert review step verified the responses generated by the AI model for its fidelity with themes by the expert. The responses were discarded completely or partially, if they did not represent the themes used under the study. Final step is the data analysis which assessed the thematic similarity between different *archana* forms. An unsupervised ML technique called Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) was used for the analysis. The analysis was done using Spyder IDE of the python programming language. 

## Results and Discussion
### *Data collection*
The study used the purposive sampling approach to select sample literature from various religious books for each *archana* form. The key characteristic used for sample selection is the commonality of its usage  in the daily practice by devotees. An expert opinion is sought for the sample selection. Accordingly, digamber *Jinvani*, a sacred and a commonly used book for *archana*, is used as the sample literature source. One sample of each *archana* type (Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 3) is also selected  from the book.

### *Theme Selection*
The study used the expert judgement to define the themes for comparing the different *archana* types. The expert suggested the themes based on primary understanding expected from the devotees. Three themes are selected for this study, namely, virtues of *Bhagwan*, rituals and motivation of *shravak*. The virtues of *Bhagwan* theme intends to identify the ideas in each *archana* type which represents the inherent qualities and attributes of the *Bhagwan*. The rituals theme intends to identify the ideas in each *archana* type which represents the various practices which a Jain devotee may pursue as a part of his relgion. The motivation of *shravak* theme intends to identify the ideas in each *archana* type which represents the different intentions which a devotee may draw from the literature.
