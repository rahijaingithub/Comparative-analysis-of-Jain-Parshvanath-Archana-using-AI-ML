## Background
In Digamber Jain tradition, God (*Bhagwan*) *archana* forms an important part of practicing the religion. However, many devotees, especially younger generation, may struggle to comprehend the meaning and importance of performing *archana*. Further, existence of different forms of *archana* like *Puja*, *Aarti* and *Chalisa* only adds to the complexity of comprehending the practice.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the new disruptive technologies which have gained the traction for their abilities to process literature and knowledge and provide valuable insights. Thus, it will be relevant to use the AI and ML techniques to understand the different *archanas* done in the Digamber Jain tradition.

This study compares the three different forms of  *archanas* i.e., *Puja*, *Aarti* and *Chalisa* to better understand their thematic similarities and differences. A case study approach is used, thus *archana* literature of Parshvanath *Bhagwan* is used for this study.

## Methodology
The methodology for the study could be divided into five main steps namely, data collection, theme selection, prompt engineering and AI analysis, expert review and formatting and data analysis. The first step in the study is data collection. The relevant literature on Parshvanath *Bhagwan archana* is collected using purposive sampling approach. The next step is theme selection, which selected the themes used for comparing the sample literature. 

## Results and Discussion
### Data collection
The study used the purposive sampling approach to select sample literature for each *archana* form. The key characteristic is that the literature is used commonly in the daily practice of devotees. An expert opinion is sought for this seelction. Accordingly, digamber *Jinvani*, a sacred and most commonly used book for *archana*, is used as the literature source. One sample of each *archana* type is selected (Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 3) from the book.
