# Comparative analysis of Jain *Bhagwan* Parshvanath Digamber Archana using AI and ML
## Background
In Digamber Jain tradition, God (*Bhagwan*) *archana* forms an important part of practicing the religion. However, many devotees, especially younger generation, may struggle to comprehend the meaning and importance of performing *archana*. Further, existence of different forms of *archana* like *Puja*, *Aarti* and *Chalisa* only adds to the complexity of comprehending the practice.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the new disruptive technologies which have gained the traction for their abilities to process literature and knowledge and provide valuable insights. Thus, it will be relevant to use the AI and ML techniques to understand the different *archanas* done in the Digamber Jain tradition.

This study compares the three different forms of  *archanas* i.e., *Puja*, *Aarti* and *Chalisa* to better understand their thematic similarities and differences. A case study approach is used, thus *archana* literature of *Parshvanath Bhagwan* is used for this study.
